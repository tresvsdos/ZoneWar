For `map_value`, the field path is represented by a dot-delimited (`.`) string of segments. Each segment is either a simple field name (defined below) or a quoted field name. For example, the structured field `\"foo\" : { map_value: { \"x&y\" : { string_value: \"hello\" }}}` would be represented by the field path `` foo.`x&y` ``. A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example, `foo_bar_17`. A quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be escaped using a `\\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and `` `bak\\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.","type":"object"},"name":{"description":"The resource name of the document, for example `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.","type":"string"},"updateTime":{"description":"Output only.
